# national-parks
This web application was completed as a capstone project for Tech Elevator, an intensive, 14-week coding school. The application uses a server (I used Apache Tomcat).

##Description

I created a dynamic web application which allows users to browse a selection of National Parks for more information about each park. While viewing a specific park's details, users can also view the upcoming five-day forecast with the ability to set the temperature to Farenheit or Celsius. Users can also vote for their favorite park and view a running list of parks with the most votes.
